Beammech is a package for solving the differential equations for pure bending
d²y/dx² = M/(E·I) and shear dy/dx = α·V/(G·A) of beams.

The main interface is the ``solve`` function. It returns a ``types.SimpleNamespace``.
Saving the returned information to file is done with the ``save`` function.

Before we can solve the problem we need to define it.
The length of the beam and the location of the supports are the initial
parameters.

.. code-block:: python

    import beammech as bm

    length = 2287
    supports = (6, 780)

The length and the locations of the supports will be rounded to the
nearest integer.  The beam will stretch from x = 0 to x = length.  The value
of ``supports`` must be a 2-tuple of integers or ``None``.  If necessary the
supports will be placed into ascending order.  The beam is assumed to be simply
supported at the two support points.  This means that vertical movement of
those points is prescribed as 0, but rotation of the beam around those points
is not restricted.  If the value of supports is ``None``, the beam is assumed to
be clamped at x=0.

We need to define some loads on the beam.  Several types of load are defined,
all of them acting in the y-direction.

* Point load
* Distributed load
* Triangle load; starts at 0 and rises linearly to the end. The force given is
  the total load.

Rather than being concentrated at a single location, a distributed load is
evenly spread out between its start and end positions.  You can think of it as
a small point load on every mm between the start and end points.  The sum of
all those small loads is the given load.  The triangle load starts at zero and
rises linearly to the end point.  Again the force given is the sum of all
small loads on the intermediate points.  Loads are created using keyword
arguments. The magnitude of the load can be given one of several keywords;

* force: a force in Newtons
* kg: a mass in kg

The mass in kg is converted to a force in Newtons.  Standard Earth gravity is
used in the -y direction (-9.81 m/s²).

.. code-block:: python

    L1 = bm.Load(force=-2000, pos=1000)
    L2 = bm.DistLoad(kg=50, start=1500, end=2000)
    L3 = bm.TriangleLoad(force=-200, start=1500, end=1200)

These is a function called “patientload” which creates a list of DistLoad
objects forming the standard weight distribution of a human body according to
IEC 60601.  The length of the standard patient is 1900 mm.  The feet of the
patient point to x = 0.  The mass of the patient is specified in kg and either
the location of the feet or the head of the patient can be given.

.. code-block:: python

    L4 = bm.patientload(kg=250, head=2287)
    L4 = bm.patientload(kg=280, feet=1200)

The loads are added to the problem definition in the form of a single load or
in the form of an iterable of loads.

.. code-block:: python

    loads = [L1, L2, L3]

The only thing missing now to characterize the beam completely are the bending
stiffness E·I, the shear stiffness G·A and the distance from the neutral line
to the top and bottom of the beam at each mm along the length of the beam.
Calculating these properties can be difficult for beams made out of different
materials (e.g. sandwich structures).  For every point in the length the
products E·I, G·A and the top- and bottom distance from the neutral line are
gathered in a numpy array and added to the problem dictionary.  In the example
below a constant rectangular cross-section is used for simplicity.  But it is
in the composition of these arrays that you can construct basically any
variation in beam geometry.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

    E = 69500  # Young's modulus of aluminium [MPa]
    G = 26000  # shear modulus of aluminium [MPa]
    B, H = 30, 3
    I, A = B*H**3/12, B*H
    n = length+1
    EI = np.ones(n)*E*I
    GA = np.ones(n)*G*A
    top = np.ones(n)*H/2
    bot = np.ones(n)*-H/2

Observe that the length of the numpy arrays needs to be one more than the
length of the beam, because it must contain values from 0 up to *and
including* the length.

Having gathered all the data for the problem, be can now let the software
solve it.

.. code-block:: python

    results = bm.solve(length, supports, loads, EI, GA, top, bot, True)

This will raise a KeyError if values are missing from the problem definition,
or a ValueError if incorrect values are used.  On successful completion, the
results are returned in a types.SimpleNamespace.
This has the following members:

D
    A numpy array containing the shear force in the cross-section at each mm
    of the beam.

M
    A numpy array containing the bending moment in the cross-section at each mm
    of the beam.

y
    A numpy array containing the vertical displacement at each mm of the beam.

a
    A numpy array containing angle between the tangent line of the beam and the
    x-axis in radians at each mm of the beam.

etop
    A numpy array containing the strain at the top of the cross-section at
    each mm of the beam.

ebot
    A numpy array containing the strain at the bottom of the cross-section at
    each mm of the beam.

R
    If 'supports' was provided, R is a 2-tuple of the reaction forces at said
    supports. Else R[0] is the reaction force at the clamped x=0 and R[1] is
    the reaction moment at that point
